galaxy hinges on the fate of one boy... though he does not yet know it.
Growing up on the desert world Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker never thought
he would venture beyond the small life he has. Simple, boyhood pursuits
seem like the only things he should be concerned with. But destiny has
other things in mind... Plot summary On the galactic frontier of the
Outer Rim, the planet Tatooine orbits the inner edge of the twin suns
Tatoo I and Tatoo II. A clan of Jawas loots a crashed starship while a
band of Tusken Raiders watches on from the cliffs overhead. As one
observes the Jawas through a pair of electrobinoculars, two Tuskens pore
over a poster advertising the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. The Tuskens
mount their banthas and follow the Jawa procession towards the spaceport
settlement of Mos Espa. There, in the junkyard owned by the Toydarian
junk dealer Watto, the slave boy Anakin Skywalker works under a large
bin with a fusioncutter, and is watched keenly by a womp rat. The
critter dashes into a tripwire, springing a trap and causing Anakin to
bump his head in the commotion. He's met by Amee, who notices the
ensnared womp rat. Anakin cuts it free, stating that all living things
should be free, and continues to search for parts for his secret
podracer. The pair spot a herd of banthas, unusually close to the
settlement, which Anakin suggests is because a storm is coming.
Attempting to return to the shop before he can be yelled at by Watto,
Anakin again encounters the womp rat, which sits on a gleaming energy
binder. Surprised, Anakin inspects the device, having usually been able
to know where to find things in Watto's junkyard. Anakin's inspection is
interrupted by Watto, whose yelling in Huttese brings the boy and Amee
inside the shop. He tasks Anakin with obtaining a thermal veristat and
Thruster relays from the visiting Jawas, and admonishes Anakin for
destroying his podracer in the boy's last race. Watto threatens to beat
Anakin blind, to which the boy quips that he would not be able to race
if he was blind. Watto points out that he doesn't have a podracer to fly
anyway, and sends Anakin away. The boy meets his mother, Shmi Skywalker,
who asks him to buy fruit from Jira on his way. He asks her to hide his
new energy binder, and sets off for the plaza. Wandering through the
crowds, Anakin is accosted by his friends Kitster and Wald, the latter
of whom has acquired a peggat Kitster hopes to spend on a ruby bliel.
The boys stop off at Jira's stall, and learn her cooling unit has broken
down. She gives Anakin some pika fruits for his mother, and Anakin
promises to find a replacement unit in the junkyard. They head for Maggy
the Gorgon's, but happen upon Sebulba the Dug in the street, admonishing
his band over his entrance music for the podrace. Sebulba mocks Anakin
about his crash in their last race, and Anakin accuses his rival of
cheating and killing fellow racer Rimkar. The two square off, and are
about to scuffle when a cantina patron is knocked through the doorway of
Maggy's, interrupting the pair. An old spacer and previous acquaintance
of Anakin's sees Sebulba off, and warns the slave boys not to go into
Maggy's today, instead giving them a ruby bliel to share. Anakin asks
the retired pilot to tell him about the Angels of Iego again when he
comes back. Anakin vows that one day he'll become a deep-space pilot and
walk on all the planets. As Anakin catches up with his friends, a Duros
asks the spacer why he bothers talking to the slave, to which the old
human replies that there is something about Anakin. The pair laugh it
off and return inside Maggy's, where the Xexto podracer Gasgano is in
the midst of a violent bar brawl. Forcing his opponents to exclaim the
virtues of his Ord Pedrovia podracer, Gasgano is bitten by a Gran.
Meanwhile, Aldar Beedo and Wan Sandage negotiate a deal to eliminate
Sebulba from the race, while Ark Roose watches Skywalker from the
window, plotting his revenge against the boy. Unbeknownst, Anakin and
his friends find the Jawa traders, but only in time to watch a pit droid
buying exactly the parts Skywalker is looking for. Back at the shop,
Watto is furious with Anakin, and makes him clean the bins again. Anakin
gives his mother the fruit from Jira, and Shmi takes a moment to look at
her son, momentarily fearing that she might not see him again. Seeing
him off, Shmi warns Anakin of the approaching storm. In the junkyard,
Anakin again discovers the womp rat he saved, now standing on a cooling
unit. Anakin sits on top of it happily, and stares up at the sky in time
to spot a ship coming in a high speed. Anakin wonders if it was an
Angel, and dreams of one leading warriors into battle on planets without
number. He sees himself as a Jedi, holding a glowing lightsaber as
chained hands reach out to him imploringly. However, he is stirred from
his vision by Watto's voice, and arrives at the shop in time to find the
Toydarian has visitors: Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar Jar Binks, R2-D2, and the
beautiful young Padmé Naberrie, whom Skywalker thinks of as the Angel of
his dreams. Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones is a 2002 film
directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is
the second part of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The film is set nine
years after the Battle of Naboo, when the galaxy is on the brink of
civil war. Under the leadership of renegade Jedi Master Count Dooku,
thousands of systems threaten to secede from the Republic. When an
assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala, the former Queen
of Naboo, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her,
while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the
assassination attempt. Soon the Jedi are drawn into the heart of the
Separatist movement, and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy:
the Clone Wars. Attack of the Clones was the first Star Wars film to use
a high-definition digital 24-frame system for most of the its
live-action scenes. The film was a financial success, grossing over $600
million at the worldwide box office. However, for the first time, a Star
Wars film did not earn the highest box-office sales for the year; Attack
of the Clones ended up fourth behind The Lord of the Rings: The Two
Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Spider-Man. Star
Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 film written and
directed by George Lucas. It is the third and final part of the Star
Wars prequel trilogy. Three years after the First Battle of Geonosis and
onset of the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights have been leading a
massive clone army into a galaxy-wide battle against the Confederacy of
Independent Systems. The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic
reveals his true nature as a Sith Lord as he unveils a plot to rule the
galaxy by transforming the Republic into a Galactic Empire. Jedi hero
Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the dark side of the Force to become
Darth Sidious's new apprentice Darth Vader. The Jedi are all but
eliminated with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Yoda forced into hiding.
The only hope for the galaxy is Anakin's own offspring—the twin children
born in secrecy who will grow up to become Luke Skywalker and Leia
Organa. Revenge of the Sith was released in theaters on Thursday, May
19, 2005 (the same day that the first episode of the prequel trilogy The
Phantom Menace was released in 1999), and premiered (out of competition)
on the 2005 Cannes Festival May 15. The film was generally positively
received by critics, especially in comparison to the two previous
prequels. It broke several box office records in its opening week and
went on to earn over US $800 million worldwide, making it one of the
top-grossing movies of 2005. It is the second Star Wars film which used
a high-definition digital 24 frame system for most of the movie's
live-action scenes. The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in
September of 2011. On November 12, 2019, the film was included with the
launch of Disney+. Episode IV: A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD is
a young-readers' story from Disney–Lucasfilm Press, released on February
10, 2015, written by Randy Thornton and illustrated by Brian Rood. It
presents an illustrated version of the story of Star Wars: Episode IV A
New Hope and also features an accompanying CD with narration of the
story and character voices. Publisher summary Experience Star Wars:
Episode IV A New Hope like never before! Fully illustrated with gorgeous
images by Star Wars artist Brian Rood, this epic storybook also includes
a CD with word-for-word narration, music, and character voices. Follow
along as Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescues Princess Leia, and
faces Darth Vader for the first time. Plot summary In a galaxy torn by
conflict, a vessel carrying secret plans for the Galactic Empire's
ultimate weapon, the Death Star, races towards Tatooine. It is
intercepted by the Devastator, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, but
before the Empire's agents have time to the search the ship, the
Princess Leia Organa hides the plans in the memory banks of the droid
R2-D2 and sends him and his companion, C-3PO, in an escape pod to
Tatooine. Leia Organa is captured by the feared agent of the Empire, the
Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, but refuses to provide him with any
information. Being that she is an Imperial Senator, he declares her a
traitor to the Empire and orders her taken away for questioning. On the
planet Tatooine, the droids find themselves captured by Jawa scavengers.
They are then sold to the moisture farmer Owen Lars, who tells his
nephew, Luke Skywalker, to clean them up so that they can be of service
on the Lars moisture farm. While examining the droids, Luke accidentally
activates a portion of a secret message programmed in the R2 series
astromech droid, R2-D2. The holographic message depicts the woman from
the Tantive IV, Leia Organa, stating "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
only hope." Skywalker is dazzled by the image of the beautiful woman. He
isn't sure who "Obi-Wan Kenobi" is, but does know of an old Ben Kenobi,
a sort of strange old hermit who lives out beyond the Dune Sea. Fearing
that the droids may have been stolen, Luke sets off in a landspeeder to
pay a visit to Ben Kenobi. Upon arrival, Kenobi is able to access the
full message stored within R2's databanks, which is a message from Leia
Organa appealing to Kenobi in the name of his service during the Clone
Wars, asking him to deliver the droids to Alderaan, as the R2 unit
contains information vital to the continued survival of the Rebel
Alliance. At this point, Kenobi informs Skywalker that he was once a
Jedi Knight, as Skywalker's father was. Skywalker is surprised, as he
didn't know his father was ever a Jedi. Kenobi gives Skywalker his
father's lightsaber and tells him that he must learn the ways of the
Force if he's to come with him to Alderaan. Skywalker, not ready to give
up his life on Tatooine, tells him that he can only take him as far as
Anchorhead. Kenobi grimly replies that he must do what he feels is
right. While traveling to Anchorhead, the group discovers that the Jawa
sandcrawler with had previously borne R2-D2 and C-3PO had been destroyed
by Imperial forces. Skywalker realizes that this means the Imperials
would have tracked the trail back to the Lars homestead, but it's too
late, and the entire property has been destroyed. Turning to Kenobi, he
tells him that he wants to join him on his mission to Alderaan. The two
travel to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where they meet with Han Solo of
the Millennium Falcon and his Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca. They make a
deal to travel on Solo's ship to travel to Alderaan and while they head
off to sell their landspeeder for some extra money, Solo has a
discussion with Jabba, a vicious Hutt that he owes money too. The two
come to an agreement that Solo can pay him after completing this next
charter, but if he fails again, then Jabba will bring down an army of
bounty hunters upon him. As the Millennium Falcon departs for Alderaan,
an unpleasant scene unfolds upon the Death Star. Princess Leia Organa is
brought before the station's commander, Wilhuff Tarkin, who tells her
that before her execution, he'd like her to witness "a ceremony that
will make this battle station fully operational." The full force and
power of the station's feared weapon, the superlaser, is then brought to
bear on Alderaan, completely obliterating Organa's home planet. At the
same time, the Millennium Falcon emerges from hyperspace, only for the
crew to find that the planet they're trying to reach apparently isn't
there, only a "small moon." Obi-Wan Kenobi, however, realizes "That's no
moon. That's a space station." The ship is quickly caught in a tractor
beam from said space station and pulled in. When Imperial forces search
the ship, however, they find it empty, as everyone has hidden in secret
compartments. Once the Imperial forces leave, the group emerges and
sneaks on-board the Death Star. Obi-Wan Kenobi sets off to disable the
tractor beam and as he does so, the droid R2-D2 plugs into an Imperial
computer and discovers that Leia Organa is aboard the station. Skywalker
convinces Solo and Chewbacca to join him on a rescue mission to save the
princess. He and Solo disguise themselves as Imperial stormtroopers that
are escorting their prisoner, Chewbacca. The ruse works and Skywalker
discovers the Princess's cell. He informs her of who he is and that he's
come to rescue her. The group beats a hasty retreat as stormtroopers
bear down, but it soon becomes clear that they have no real plan of
escape. Organa, unimpressed, decides to create her own plan and directs
the group to take refuge down a garbage chute. The group lands safely on
a pile of smelly garbage, but then finds the walls closing in on them.
They've landed in a garbage masher. They are very nearly crushed, but
Luke Skywalker suddenly remembers the droids and pages R2-D2 on his
comlink, getting him to shut the garbage masher down. While all of this
happens, Ben Kenobi finds the controls for the tractor beam and disables
it. On his way back to the Millennium Falcon, however, he encounters
Darth Vader, his former student who has now turned to the dark side of
the Force. As the two engage in a fierce duel, Skywalker and the others
make for the Millennium Falcon, but Skywalker is shocked when Kenobi
seems to simply stop fighting in the middle of the duel, his robes
collapsing in a crumpled heap as Vader swings through them. Skywalker is
horrified by what he is just witnessed, but there is no time for
mourning as he and the others escape the Death Star. Before making the
leap to hyperspace, the crew fights off four Imperial TIE/ln space
superiority starfighters. They arrive safely at the Rebel base on Yavin
4, but have no time to celebrate, as the Empire placed a homing beacon
on the Millennium Falcon, leading them directly to the Rebels. With the
secret plans in their possession, however, the Rebels are able to put
together a plan-of-action and launch their X-wing starfighters against
the Empire's forces, which even include a TIE fighter flown by Darth
Vader himself. In a fierce and challenging battle, after one of the
rebel pilots fails to hit the Death Star's weak spot, everything is up
to Luke Skywalker, whom Vader has right on his tail. Noting "The Force
is strong is strong with this one," Vader prepares to fire, only for a
laser blast to impact the vessel of his wingman, sending his own ship
careening off into space. Solo comms that Skywalker is clear and as
Skywalker makes his run, he hears the voice of Ben Kenobi telling him to
"use the Force." He fires two proton torpedos, landing a direct hit that
causes the Death Star to explode. Back on Yavin, everyone gathers to
celebrate this great victory over the Empire. Both Han Solo and Luke
Skywalker are awarded Medals of Bravery by Leia Organa, but though
everyone is happy for their victory, they know that the Empire, Darth
Vader and the feared Galactic Emperor remain a grave threat.[4]
Omissions and modifications A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD is a
picture book and audio retelling of the events of Star Wars: Episode IV
A New Hope, but omits a number of details and scenes to fit the story
within the format of a 32-page picture book. The opening scene aboard
the Tantive IV is presented largely as it is in the film, simply
omitting certain dialogue unnecessary to the story. The story then skips
ahead to C-3PO and R2-D2 being captured by the Jawa scavengers, the
details of the journey through the desert omitted. Luke Skywalker's
story begins with him visiting the Jawas to purchase the droids with
Owen Lars, though Owen himself is not pictured. R5-D4 appears only in
the book's illustration. The story continues with Luke examining the
droids in the garage, omitting all material with Luke speaking with his
aunt and uncle and the character of Beru Whitesun Lars entirely. R2-D2
is shown playing back the message from Leia Organa, but there is no
mention of Luke attempting to remove a restraining bolt from him, nor
having placed it in the first place. Rather than R2-D2 escaping into the
Jundland Wastes, it is instead suggested that Luke boards his
landspeeder directly with both droids and proceeds directly to deliver
them to Obi-Wan Kenobi, fearing that they had been stolen. As such, all
scenes involving the Tusken Raiders and the danger in the desert are
omitted. Upon arrival, Kenobi discovers the full message from Organa
immediately and only tells Luke Skywalker of his history as a Jedi and
offers him his father's lightsaber after the message has been played,
though he does not tell Luke that Darth Vader killed his father. The
scene following, in which those on the Death Star receive news of the
dissolution of the Imperial Senate and in which Vader chokes Admiral
Conan Antonio Motti, is omitted entirely. The story continues with
Skywalker and Kenobi finding the Lars homestead destroyed and traveling
to Mos Eisley, though they are not shown encountering the stormtroopers,
nor does Skywalker get into trouble in the Mos Eisley Cantina. Han Solo
is not shown having to fend off Greedo, thus skirting the question of
who shot first, though he is shown talking with Jabba the Hutt and
promising him that he now has a "nice easy charter" and will be able to
pay him back. On the Death Star, Leia Organa is taken before Wilhuff
Tarkin, but there is never any mention of her being tortured for
information and while Alderaan is destroyed, it seems to be done simply
out of spite and to horrify Organa. The story then arrives at the
Millennium Falcon emerging from hyperspace, with Skywalker's training
with Ben Kenobi and the game of dejarik between R2-D2 and Chewbacca
depicted only the book's front cover. The arrival at the Death Star and
hiding then boarding is largely the same as in the film, though no
reference is made to Vader detecting a familiar presence. Luke's
persuasion of Solo is only briefly described and no mention is made of
the droids being left behind during the rescue of Princess Leia, nor of
the difficulties the group encounters prior to them actually escaping
with the princess. Though the garbage compactor scene is depicted, the
living creature within it is not mentioned. The remainder of the events
of the escape from the Death Star are highly compressed, with the group
described as simply escaping from the garbage masher and then arriving
at the docking bay, where they witness the battle between Darth Vader
and Obi-Wan Kenobi. This is described generally as it occurs in the
film, with the Millennium Falcon's escape and battle with TIE fighters
described in a couple of brief sentences. Following the Millennium
Falcon's arrival at the Rebel base, all scenes involving the discussion
of how to take down the Death Star and Luke Skywalker meeting up with
Biggs Darklighter are omitted. Additionally, no mention is made of Han
Solo choosing to leave with Chewbacca in order to pay his debt to Jabba.
The story instead proceeds immediately to the Rebel Alliance's assault
against the Death Star. This is described in a few brief paragraphs with
no mention of Wedge Antilles, nor by name of any Rebel pilot other than
Skywalker. None of the scenes during the battle on the Death Star itself
are depicted. Following the battle, the story ends with a depiction of
Skywalker and Solo being presented with medals of valor. Episode V: The
Empire Strikes Back Read-Along Storybook and CD is a young readers'
story from Disney–Lucasfilm Press, that was released on March 10, 2015.
It presents an illustrated version of the story of Star Wars: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back and also features an accompanying CD with
narration of the story and character voices. Publisher summary The
Rebellion faces its darkest hour in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire
Strikes Back. Fully illustrated with gorgeous images by Star Wars artist
Brian Rood, this epic storybook also includes a CD with word-for-word
narration, music, and character voices. Follow along as Luke Skywalker
trains with Yoda to become a Jedi and defeat the fearsome Darth Vader.
Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, marketed as simply Return of
the Jedi, is a 1983 film directed by Richard Marquand and written by
Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas from a story by Lucas. It is the third
and final part of the Star Wars original trilogy. Luke Skywalker and
friends travel to Tatooine to rescue their companion Han Solo from the
vile Jabba the Hutt. The Empire prepares to crush the Rebellion with a
more powerful Death Star, while the Rebel fleet mounts a massive attack
on the space station. Luke confronts his father, Anakin Skywalker, in a
final climactic duel before the evil Emperor Sidious. The film debuted
on May 25, 1983, and was released on VHS and LaserDisc in this form
multiple times during the 80s and 90s. The film was re-released with
changes in 1997, and this version was later released on VHS and
LaserDisc as well. The special edition arrived on DVD in 2004, but with
further updates and changes to the 1997 versions. The original,
unaltered version of the film was released as part of a DVD set in
September 2006. The film was re-released in the Blu-ray format in
September of 2011. Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, marketed as
Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is a 2015 film directed by J.J. Abrams;
co-written by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt; and produced
by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and Bad Robot Productions. It is
the first part of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film stars Harrison
Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew
reprising their original roles. The original actors are joined by a host
of new actors including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and
Oscar Isaac. The story begins thirty years after the events of Star
Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The First Order has risen from the
ashes of the Galactic Empire and is opposed by General Leia Organa and
the Resistance, both of which seek to find the missing Jedi Master Luke
Skywalker. In the midst of this search, new heroes rise in the form of
Rey, a 19 year-old girl and a Force-sensitive scavenger from Jakku;
Finn, a stormtrooper who defected from the First Order; and Poe Dameron,
the best pilot in the Resistance. They are aided by Han Solo in their
search for Skywalker and their mission to destroy the First Order's new
superweapon, Starkiller Base, which targets the New Republic and the
Resistance for destruction. They are opposed by villains such as Kylo
Ren, a dark warrior with a mysterious past; and General Armitage Hux,
the commander of Starkiller Base. Despite initially claiming that the
Star Wars story ended with the redemption of Anakin Skywalker in Return
of the Jedi, and after spending years refuting speculation that there
would be another film, Star Wars creator George Lucas began work on
Episode VII in 2011 in order to increase the value of Lucasfilm before
he sold it to The Walt Disney Company, although Disney would later elect
to not use Lucas' story. The acquisition was finalized on October 30,
2012. Disney and Lucasfilm officially announced Episode VII and the
sequel trilogy the same day. Lucasfilm later announced that the film
would be an original story not beholden to the continuity of the Star
Wars Expanded Universe, which was rebranded as the non-canon Star Wars
Legends. The Force Awakens was released on December 17, 2015 in the
United Kingdom, Mexico, Latin America, and Asian countries; December 18,
2015 in North America; and January 9, 2016 in China. Some North American
theaters offered special limited advance showings on the evening of
December 17th rather than the traditional midnight showing. The film
received widespread critical praise upon its release and was a massive
box office success, becoming the highest grossing film of all time in
North America when not adjusted for inflation. Worldwide, the film was
the third highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release
(behind Avatar and Titanic). It is currently the fourth highest-grossing
film of all time (behind Avengers: Endgame, Avatar and Titanic). Star
Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, marketed as Star Wars: The Last Jedi,
is a 2017 film written and directed by Rian Johnson and produced by
Kathleen Kennedy and Ram Bergman, along with executive producer J.J.
Abrams. It is the second part of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film
sees the return of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy
Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson,
Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, and Andy Serkis. New cast members
include Benicio Del Toro, Laura Dern, and Kelly Marie Tran. The Last
Jedi begins immediately after the events of Star Wars: Episode VII The
Force Awakens, set thirty years after the conclusion of the original
Star Wars trilogy. It continues the story of Rey and her discovery of
the exiled Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, along with the story of the war
between General Leia Organa's Resistance and the First Order. The film
was released on December 14, 2017 in Hong Kong, Mexico, Latin America,
and European countries; December 15, 2017 in North America; and January
5, 2018 in China. Some North American theaters offered special limited
advance showings on the evening of December 14th rather than the
traditional midnight showing. The Last Jedi garnered four nominations at
the 90th Academy Awards, including Best Original Score and Best Visual
Effects. The following and final installment of the sequel trilogy, Star
Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, was released on December 20,
2019. Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, marketed as Star
Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, is a 2019 film directed by J.J. Abrams from
a script by Abrams and Chris Terrio. It is the third and final part of
the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The film, produced by Lucasfilm president
Kathleen Kennedy, is a continuation of 2015's The Force Awakens, which
Abrams also directed and co-wrote, and 2017's The Last Jedi. Lucasfilm

installment of the Skywalker saga. The film stars Carrie Fisher, Mark
Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony
Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita
Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, with Ian
McDiarmid and Billy Dee Williams. Fisher, who passed away in 2016 prior
to the film's production, appeared via unused footage from The Force
Awakens. The film was first announced after The Walt Disney Company
acquired Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. Colin Trevorrow was initially announced
as the director and writer of the film, but he and Lucasfilm parted ways
in September 2017, with Lucasfilm citing "creative differences" over the
project. On September 12, 2017, Abrams and Terrio were announced as the

Editing. It has grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the
forty-sixth highest-grossing film of all time. Episode XXIV: Death on
the Rim was the twenty-fourth instalment of the historical holodrama
series True Tales of the Ancient Republic. It was released in 114 BBY.
Set during the Kymoodon Era, it followed the exploits of the Sector
Ranger Novan Nune, who fought to rescue the colonists of Parcovey Minor
